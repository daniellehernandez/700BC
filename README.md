The setting is in 700 B.C., Artemis (goddess of the moon), Athena (goddess of wisdom), Hermes (the messenger god), Hades (god of the underworld) and Apollo (god of the sun) were on Earth scouting for giant rebels when the gates of Mount Olympus was forcibly closed. Apparently, Chronos was accidentally revived by a demigod, named Stultus. Stultus then rushes to the 5 gods outside Olympus to seek help but he finds out that even they were  already compelled by Chronus... driven to a corner he then takes a potion in his pocket and chooses one hero. He has only one choice and that choice will save Mount Olympus.
